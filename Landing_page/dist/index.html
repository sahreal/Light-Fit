          Incorporating self-care and wellness into your daily routines doesn’t
          have to be all or nothing. Light + Fit believes health deserves a
          lighter outlook! It is about what fits for you. Through this app, we
          want to bring feel-good experiences that help you focus on your
          wellness, while having fun along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new app will share easy to do at-home wellness videos, including
          workouts routines and mediations, along with movement reminders and
          WFH wellness tips throughout the workday. Messages will include
          reminders to drink water, tips on how to best organize your desk for
          productivity, and ways to communicate boundaries to friends and family
          when working remotely.
